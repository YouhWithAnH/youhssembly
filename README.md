## Youhssembly
Youhssembly is a minimalist programming language inspired by assembly. It is meant to be ran in a python environment, as such, it's horribly prototyped and incredibly slow (as is any python program, let's be frank). Do not expect speed, only fancy results.\
To run a youhssembly file, install the latest python release, write any text file (I recommend a file with .ysm for clearing up) and run it with the following command in bash:
```bash
$ python youhssembly.py <file>
```
To demonstrate, the file "test.ysm" included in the repository runs
```ysm
ECHO Hello, world!
```
and outputs `Hello, world! ` in the console.\
The program comes prepackaged with a rudimentary 4 digit precision timer to see how long the program has elapsed for.
### Why is this getting published?
Because this is a first contact with parsing and lexing as a whole. Like any form of art, the best way to learn is to practice, and documenting can be a fun way to get updates later on your career.
Feel free to experiment with Youhssembly as much as you'd like, and let me know what you can do with it!
